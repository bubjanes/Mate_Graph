Mate Image Detector
A mate is a special cup made of wood, plastic or gourd. It is used, with a metal ´bombilla´ or straw, to drink yerba mate, a popular tea in the southern cone of South America. This project uses TensorFlow´s Object Detection API to train a model (using transfer learning with ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco) to detect mates in images and live video.

This project was inspired by The TensorFlow API, datitran´s racoon dataset, and Sentdex´s PythonProgramming blog.

Software used to train:
ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco and
labelImg (by tzutalin) - for drawing the boxes in the training
